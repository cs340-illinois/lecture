# Lecture Code for CS 340

## Standalone C Code

Most examples are standalone code and can be compiled using:

```
gcc file.c
```

By default, `gcc` generates the output file `a.out`.  Run `a.out` to run the program you just compiled:

```
./a.out
```

## Multi-file C Code

Occasionally, examples extend multiple files and a `Makefile` will be provided.
